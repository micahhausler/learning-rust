# Learning

I'm learning Rust, so this is just for fun.

No, the code in this repository is not perfect, its just here for me to learn, and maybe for you to learn something too.
Its got bugs, so don't use it for anything serious.
If you want to open an issue, it must soley be for my educational purposes, and you must not be a know-it-all or a jerk.
If you want to open a PR, you must explain in grotesque detail with documentation links for what you're doing.
